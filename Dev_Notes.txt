1.) I've been exposed to several different patterns of keeping state.

One thing which I've been surprised about is how is how none of the major GraphQl Apollo examples use Redux.

They are keeping state many times on the server using Subscriptions (Githunt) and local state (Handsup)

In the Githunt case, state is being kept on the Modal only (Votes)
In the Handsup case state is being kept locally, with a mutation on the server (Votes)

2.) Rendering Logic (ie. isLoading)

Watch for how this accomplished in both

3.) Passing Props Down Generally

Watch for which props are being passed down to components
